Here are some of the subjects you'll be learning as part of the synthetic chemistry project:
**Organic chemistry**: multistep organic synthesis; purification by chromatography, vacuum distillation, and recrystallization; oxidation, reduction, carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, amine chemistry; laboratory safety techniques
**Inorganic and coordination chemistry**: transition metal complexing; inert atmosphere techniques including schlenk line and glovebox techniques
**Characterization of organic and inorganic compounds**: mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, magnetic moment determination, conductance experiments, crystal growth and selection for X-ray crystallography, UV visible spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy
