## Computers and Internet
**Personal laptops are not permitted at SSP** - if you must bring one, turn it in to the Site Director when you arrive. You can pick it up on Departure Day.

WiFi may or may not be available at your host campus, and each one has a different WiFi policy that is subject to change. However, you will have consistent access to the internet. You can use the computers provided to you for personal purposes as the host campus allows. However, you cannot install software that you have brought with you on a flash drive, etc.

## Religion
SSP has no religious affiliation, welcoming participants of any religion. The program will attempt to accommodate attendance to weekly religious services - if this is of importance to you, discuss it with staff during the enrollment process. The dining hall will try to accommodate dietary restrictions as well.

## Evaluation
You will not be graded during SSP, but the faculty will informally observe your work throughout the program. After SSP, you will receive a *letter of completion* to include with college applications, which will describe the program but not provide an assessment of your work.

You may also request a letter of recommendation from any staff member after the program's completion.
