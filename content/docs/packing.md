- 1 or 2 water bottles (print your name on them)
- flashlight (torch) with batteries (**required for astrophysics programs**, optional for others)
- USB flash drive for data and other files

### Optional Items
You may choose to bring:
- a backpack or bookbag
- personal recreational items like sports equipment, board games, or card games - provided they are not R-rated
- sealable plastic bags and containers to store snacks without attracting insects
- as such, plenty of snacks for the first week or two
- a laundry bag
- rubber slippers or flip flops for the bathroom
- a toiletry bag
- your own pillow, blanket, sheets, or towels - mattresses are **long twin** size. The blankets are thin and you wouldn't be able to use the towels for a beach trip
- musical instrument(s) - a piano or music practice room may be provided, but it's not guaranteed

## Do not bring:

- a laptop computer, tablet, iPad - anything electronic that is larger than a phone
- a supply of disposable/consumable items (detergent, snacks, etc) that is made to last the whole 6 weeks rather than just 1 or 2 - you will have opportunities to go shopping and replenish your supply

## Clothing
Make sure to bring clothing for **both warm and cool weather**, as well as some clothes for dinner. A collared shirt and pants, a dress, or a blouse and skirt are appropriate for such an occassion - make sure that tops don't have commercial imagery (unless it is an embroidered logo) or writing. Wear shoes or sandals with a heel strap, not flip-flops.

For College and Career Day and the Closing Dinner, bring a formal outfit (e.g. dress pants, a shirt, a jacket/sports coat, and a tie OR a blouse and skirt OR a dress, etc.) It's a good idea to bring two or three nice outfits, as there will likely be more than one dressy dinner. Bring dress shoes, of course.

**Biochem, Genomics, and SynthChem participants must completely cover their legs and feet while they work in the lab**, which they will likely be doing every day. Plan accordingly.

In the biochem wet lab, ensure that you do not bring:
- shorts
- open-toe shoes or sandals
- dresses
- skin-tight fabric, like leggings or yoga pants

Marking clothing with name tags or permanent ink is a good idea to make sure you don't lose track of it.
