SSP will follow best practices according to the Centers for Disease Control and host campuses. Everyone is expected to arrive on campus fuly vaccinated for COVID-19 and other diseases according to the instructions provided during enrollment.

Participants must disclose existing health issues or concerns, including depression, self-harm, or eating disorders, before arrival. If any additional concerns arise during the program, you must discuss them with a faculty member. Even if you are feeling stressed or upset about anything, a faculty member would be happy to listen.

SSP participants will **not be allowed to drive vehicles or to leave the designated perimeter on campus without permission**. Further rules, such as lab safety and the after-dark "buddy rule", will be detailed upon arrival.

The faculty will provide first aid and/or access to a professional healthcare provided when it is needed. However, SSP does not provide or require any form of health insurance. Beyond first aid, parents will be responsible for the full cost of medications or health care services.

Ensure that you're getting enough sleep!
