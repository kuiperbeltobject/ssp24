There will be a designated day, from Saturday evening to Sunday afternoon, where parents and guardians will be able to visit *their child*, but not the program as a whole. These visits will need to be prearranged with the Site Director first. More information about the visitor policy is coming soon and will be provided by email. Parents and guardians can stay for the Q&A session on arrival day and the closing exercises on Departure Day. They will not be able to visit on any other day.

Participants may not leave campus with anyone except a parent or guardian unless said parent or guardian has given express permission in advance by email to the Site Director.
