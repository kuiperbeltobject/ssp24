Generally, SSP is unable to acommodate people arriving before or after Arrival Day. International students may contact the SSP staff to check available options.

It is difficult for students to catch up even after missing a day or two of SSP, both because of the high information density of the program and the undue burden it would put on teammates. Leaving early is also not ideal.

SSP is an all-or-nothing program -- if it overlaps with other plans, you will need to choose between them.

If you feel as though you can justify an exception to these policies, contact staff - they will consider any requests made before enrollment is confirmed.
