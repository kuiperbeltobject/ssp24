Hi, I'm Sai! I'm an SSP '24 participant at GCSU. I made this website to serve as a more convenient location to access all the information about SSP, so that participants wouldn't have to repeatedly reference the handbook. I like sweet things, frilly dresses, variable stars, birds, hydrangeas, and RPGs. it would literally make my day if you were to play Yume 2kki with me (ynoproject.net) haha. Nice to meet you!
